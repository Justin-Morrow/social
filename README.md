# User Story
As a social media startup, I want an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database so that my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data.

# Usage

1. Make sure you have MongoDB installed on your machine (if you don't, follow the instructions on the MongoDB Website)
2. Clone the repo
3. Install dependencies with npm -i
4. Run npm start to run the server and make the API live
5. Use your browser or an app like Insomnia to test the REST API.
